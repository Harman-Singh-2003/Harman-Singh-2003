### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# I am an Engineering Systems and Computing student at the Unversity of Guelph

I am currently looking for summer 2023 internships

So far I have made a calculator website which was my first introduction to JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Then I made an edge detection website purely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The images are manipulated using JavaScript Canvas

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning fullstack web development
